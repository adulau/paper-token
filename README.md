paper token
===========

paper token is a PDF generator to create paper-based OTP (RFC 4226) token.

why?
----

Hardware tokens are very costly and often require a proprietary infrastructure.
(near impossible to find HOTP-compatible hardware token without 
requiring the linked proprietary infrastructure)
Software tokens can be also painful and always require a second device like
a phone to operate properly.

security?
---------

Paper is not less secure than a phone running a software token. With
a sheet paper and a pencil, you have the control of the token. Do you
have the control of your phone and the software running on it? 

For a negligible cost, you have a token and you just need to protect
that sheet of paper. It's simple.

An OTP is just an one-time password and this recommendation makes a
lot of sense for the paper-based token too :

"Simply, people can no longer remember passwords good enough to reliably defend against dictionary attacks, and are much more secure if they choose a password too complicated to remember and then write it down. We're all good at securing small pieces of paper. I recommend that people write their passwords down on a small piece of paper, and keep it with their other valuable small pieces of paper: in their wallet. â€”Bruce Schneier 2005"

OpenOTP server installation
===========================
You have various free software solution to run
on the server side for the authentication of the
tokens. You can have a look at the setting up
of an OpenOTP server to work with those paper-based
token.
